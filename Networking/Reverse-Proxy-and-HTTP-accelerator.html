<p>Type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client. Resources are returned to the client as if they originated from the proxy server rather than its upstreams.</p>
<p>Forward proxies act as an intermediary for the client, a Reverse proxy acts as an intermediary for groups of servers.</p>
<h3 id="varnish">Varnish</h3>
<p>Designed for content heavy dynamic web sites, focused exclusively on HTTP. Unlike others, varnish was designed as an HTTP accelerator.</p>
<ul>
<li>supports load balancing, with <code>Saint mode</code> for handling failing upstream servers by blacklisting them for quarantine periods</li>
<li>configuration mechanism is <em>Varnish Configuration Language</em>, a DSL used to write hooks that are called when handlign requests</li>
<li>VCL is compiled to C</li>
<li>supports Gzip compression</li>
<li><strong>If the server malfunctions and returns 50x errors, <code>Grace mode</code> will ignore expiry headers and continue to return cached versions</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="squid">Squid</h3>
<p>Can be used as a reverse proxy, however the technology is slightly older than Varnish, and it was originally built as a forward proxy. It has builtin ssl which Varnish does not.</p>
