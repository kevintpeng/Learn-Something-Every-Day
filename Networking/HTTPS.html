<p>Extra layer of encryption, using SSL/TLS</p>
<ul>
<li>protects the url, query params, headers, cookies</li>
<li>address (hostname) and port are a part of the TCP protocols and cannot protect the disclosure of these</li>
<li>only the server is usually authenticated, through the client examining the server's certificate<ul>
<li>the public key certificate proves ownership of a public key (so that you know the server that's able to decrypt your messages is exactly who you think they are)</li>
<li>cert contains which DNS names are a part of the cert, expiry date, issuer, and of course the public key for encryption</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a <strong>certificate authority</strong> is an entity that issues certs<ul>
<li>browsers come with a set of CA certs to automatically trust</li>
<li>operating systems have a list of available trusted root certs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at wikipedia as an example, we see <code>Issued by: GlobalSign Organization Validation CA</code></p>
<p>The issuer in this case is an <strong>intermediate certificate authority</strong></p>
<p>The intermediate certificate authorities are owned by the <strong>root certificate authority</strong>. These are trusted using some other mechanism, such as secure physical distribution.</p>
<p>This forms a <strong>chain of trust</strong> from a certificate chain.</p>
<p><strong>P12 cert</strong> is a file format for storing multiple cryptographic objects, or simply one private key and its associated certificate chain</p>
