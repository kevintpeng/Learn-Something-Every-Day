<li>we should aim for a single source of truth for things like ports<ul><li>bring together docker, kubernetes, packer</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Configuration <code>yaml</code> becomes Turing complete, maybe we can build a programming language for configurations</li>
<li>language idiomatic cloud; cloud configuration will be built into languages as a feature</li>

<p>Need a system that manages reliable, reproducible pipelines for training and prediction data</p>
<ul><li>many technologies, including Samza, distributed stream processing implemented with Kafka and YARN</li></ul>
<p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/">uber's system</a> supports deep learning and other machine learning methods</p>
<ul>
<li>makes distinction of "online vs offline" data</li>
<li>feature stores are hubs for data that has been extracted and transformed into a usable format, reusable across projects</li>
<li>offline is useful for batch model training and prediction jobs</li>
<li>the online feature store is for performant access patterns on precomputed features (aggregate features like averages over time periods)<ul>
<li>online allows for low latency reads at prediction time</li>
<li>batch precompute is good for historical features moving from offline feature store to the online cassandra feature store</li>
<li>near real-time compute comes in directly through kafka, processed by Samza to generate the aggregate feature and eventually written back to the offline feature store</li>
<li><em>so I think the purpose of the online feature store is so that models can fetch the current "state" for a user, in order to make predictions, while the offline store is for batching up training data to generate models in the first place</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>training is performed in YARN or Mesos<ul><li><em>I think by doing all the training with offline data, this doesn't enable certain classes of algorithms to be implemented, Recurrent neural networks come to mind</em></li></ul>
</li>
<li>trained models a stored in a cassandra cluster (versioned with performance and evaluation, and meta data)</li>
</ul>
