<ul><li>one perspective on important factors for building an AI startup are the 5 P's<ul>
<li>positioning: aim at a vertical, avoid horizontals covered by big tech companies</li>
<li>product: build problem solving services, not tools</li>
<li>petabytes: scrape or find data to get over chicken/egg problems</li>
<li>process: sell ideas, help customers understand what problems are solvable and not through AI</li>
<li>people: hire technical, be technical</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Network effect is the positive feedback loop that improves user experience the more users on the platform</li>
<li>Data network effect is positive feedback for AI products that improve with more data, while attracting more data providers as they improve</li>
<li>"cold start" problem is like chicken/egg problem, and a pure AI company must have a data acquisition strategy</li>
<li>data traps are interesting, you build a deliverable with tangible value to users, where useful data collection is a byproduct</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-to-one">Zero to One</h3>
<ul>
<li>it takes forward thinking to create new technology, to progress vertically not horizontally</li>
<li>technology enables vertical progress, the creation of new ways to do more, with less</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What important truth do very few people agree with you on?</em> A delusional popular belief hides a contrarian truth.</p>
<ul>
<li>1990s, most industries were in recession, except for the tech industry</li>
<li>Dot-com mania was from sept 1998 to march 2000; a Silicon Valley gold rush, a delusional popular belief</li>
<li>the burst happened in March 2000; it scared most tech companies into the following dogma:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Make incremental advances</li>
<li>Stay lean and flexible</li>
<li>Improve on the competition</li>
<li>Focus on product, not sales. The only sustainable growth is viral</li>
</ol>
<p>While this is the safe thing, the opposite principles are also valid:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's better to risk boldness</li>
<li>A bad plan is better than no plan</li>
<li>Competitive markets destroy profits</li>
<li>Sales matter just as much as product</li>
</ol>
