### [Being a senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)
- engineering maturity is more than technical growth, and is highly correlative to one's willingness to work with others, empathetically and selflessly
- giving and receiving criticism is vital for thriving in engineering, but is a fine-line between baseless complaints and assertive and constructive critique
  - it is important to give feedback on work, while avoiding personal critique
  - it is important to receive criticism humbly

### [Debugging Titles](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/debugging-titles-part-i) introduces further insight into job titles like senior engineer.
- describes pillars of engineering as programming, subject matter expertise, people leadership, craft leadership, product sense, delivery methods
- interesting that they introduce a well defined system for measuring these areas, it seems to be a guideline for growth towards "senior" rather than a definition
  - I think this system is really awesome for guiding growth, needs to be used carefully so as not to use it to compare oneself directly with others
  - if it's not done well though, you might undervalue certain members of the team accidentally, this system has to be holistic

### [An ambitious person's take on work life balance](https://medium.com/the-mission/an-ambitious-persons-take-on-work-life-balance-i-almost-lost-hope-in-my-marriage-b6f0c0355c2)
Retrospective on one person's life and how uncontrolled ambition retracted from other aspects of their life. They suggest to get the fundamentals right with a "marathon mentality", and constantly grow in six fundamental psychological and physiological areas:
- health, sleep, sanity and exercise
- wealth, investing gradually and being financially free
- relationships, having quality time and expressing love to friends and family
- work, having a fulfilling career that feeds ambition
- learning and growth, to never feel stagnation and to grow professionally and personally while expanding interests and reading books
- purpose, to define what's important to you, and tie all actions back to this purpose

Do not forgo ambition, but rather be patient with ambitious goals and be cautious sacrificing the fundamentals

### [Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2)
This is a book about the U.S. Navy SEALs and Leadership. They focus on a leadership framework called extreme ownership. It's the idea that leadership is hard, and that it comes with a plethora of responsibilities. These responsibilities can and should be delegated, but ultimately extreme ownership is the idea that you as a leader are accountable for the outcome and execution of any tasks related to a given responsibility.

This book revolves around ideas pertaining to leadership and to approaching accountability and ownership. It encourages leaders to always be looking at themselves and how they can own a situation and take responsibility and learn from faults. It uses metaphors from the military to explain how as a leader or follower in society, you can best conduct yourself with a growth mindset by understanding that you should primarily look to yourself during failures to understand how you can learn from mistakes.

The philosophy behind extreme ownership extends to understanding the vision behind a team and understanding how you as a leader or follower within a team can help to execute this vision by believing in it, and trusting and empathizing with leaders--above and below you--and their decisions.

The book presents other fundamentals of leadership: the importance of systematic planning processes, of consistent communication between leaders and their followers, of understanding dichotomies of leadership that require balance (confidence vs. humility, quiet vs. silent, ambitious vs. humble, attention vs. obsession to details)

I think the ideas presented here are not necessarily revolutionary, but it reinforces the idea that you should own as much of your world as you can, and instead of making excuses, looking for any way you can benefit from failures of your own and others. I think the caveat to this mental framework is that it is important for your own sanity and for the growth of others to share feedback when constructive, rather than selflessly absorbing failures of the team.

### [On Joining New Teams](http://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start.html)
- people tend to focus on high, early impact which can ultimately cloud long term growth and cultivate negative working relationships early
- this articles proposes and systematic approach to ramping up, while aiming to minimize collateral damage from disrespecting other peoples' time
- the method: 30 min 1:1, 25 mins for asking what's important to learn, 3 mins for understanding the biggest challenges, 2 mins for who else to talk to
- over indexes on knowledge for the current state of the team, which helps to jump in immediately, understanding all necessary terminology as a result

### [Performance](https://medium.com/cto-craft/the-hard-truth-about-performance-a-guide-for-ctos-d0481213d388)
Career growth is important for self-worth, confidence, and satisfaction. It's important in any role to set goals for yourself and ensure that whatever role you take on helps you reach those goals. It's also important to define expectations with those who evaluate you. In performance reviews, think about progress (past), plan (future) and blockers (current), and make a professional development plan for yourself to track progress and goals.
