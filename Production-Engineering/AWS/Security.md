# Security
One major priority of AWS is security. It uses a shared model where AWS fronts some of the security responsibilities while the customer must handle others. Generally this divide is between physical vs software. But AWS also provides the tools for software level security to be implemented by the customer.
- AWS infrastructure considers laws and IT security standards, which is especially important in corporate environments
- they worry about physical hardware security and availability
- **availability zones** are regions that are completely independent for fault tolerance
- **access control lists (ACLs)** are a set of rules that offer an optional layer of security for your VPC, acting as a firewall
