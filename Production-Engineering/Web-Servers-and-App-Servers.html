<p>Serve static files, but with the right modules, can also serve dynamic web apps. <a href="../Web-Technologies/Apache.md">Apache</a> is more popular with more features, <a href="../Web-Technologies/NGINX.md">NGINX</a> is faster with less features. Neither can serve Ruby web apps out-of-the-box and need additional modules.</p>
<p>Apache and NGINX can also act as reverse proxies meaning they can take incoming HTTP requests and forward it to another server, which also speaks HTTP.</p>
<p>Web servers are the front-most layer of traffic handling. Setup:</p>
<ul><li>make you HTTP available from the internet, by configuring your router to send all incoming traffic on port 80 to your server<ul>
<li>on most cloud platforms, this is handled already</li>
<li>locally, it would require going to <a href="http://192.168.1.1/" class="uri">http://192.168.1.1/</a>, and allowing traffic to pass through firewall</li>
<li>choose computer, forward external TCP traffic on port 80 to port 80 (this is port forwarding)</li>
<li>people can then connect to your local server via your public IP address</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<h2 id="apache-vs-nginx">Apache vs Nginx</h2>
<p>Both solutions are capable of handling diverse workloads. They are different in what they excel at. One big difference is how they handle connections and traffic.</p>
<h3 id="apache">Apache</h3>
<p>The Apache HTTP server was created in 1995.</p>
<ul><li>flexible, powerful, well supported, extensible through a dynamically loadable module system</li></ul>
<h3 id="nginx">Nginx</h3>
<p>2004, known for light-weight resource utilization and ability to scale easily on minimal hardware</p>
<ul>
<li>excels at serving static content quickly</li>
<li>designed to pass dynamic request off to other software</li>
<li>highly responsive under load</li>
<li>focused on core web server and proxy features</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mongrel-and-other-production-app-servers-and-webrick">Mongrel and other production app servers and WEBrick</h3>
<p>Mongrel is a Ruby "application server":</p>
<ol>
<li>It loads the Ruby app in its own process space</li>
<li><p>Sets up a TCP socket allowing it to communicate with the internet (Mongrel listens for HTTP requests on this socket and passes the request data to the Ruby web app)</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby web app returns an object which describes what the HTTP response should look like, Mongrel converts it to an actual HTTP response and sends it back over the socket.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Mongrel is dated, and newer comparable application servers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../Web-Technologies/Unicorn.md">Unicorn</a></li>
<li>Puma</li>
<li>Thin</li>
<li>Phusion Passenger</li>
</ul>
<p>WEBrick is the built in Ruby app server, but WEBrick <strong>is not fit for production</strong> (written entirely in ruby so poor performance).</p>
<h1 id="app-servers">App Servers</h1>
<p>Some app servers directly have access to the internet via port 80 while most others need to be put behind a <em>reverse proxy web server</em> using Apache or NGINX.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mongrel</strong> is bare bones, single-threaded so only useful in clusters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unicorn</strong> is a fork of Mongrel, supports limited process monitoring, automatic restart, single threaded. Allows all processes to listen on a shared socket.</li>
<li>
<strong>Thin</strong> uses the event I/O concurrency model, each process uses its own socket.</li>
<li>
<strong>Puma</strong> also forked from Mongrel, Puma is designed to be purely multi-threaded, no builtin cluster support.</li>
</ul>
