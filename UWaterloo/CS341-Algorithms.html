<h3 id="greedy-algorithms-and-their-proofs"><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs161/cs161.1138/handouts/120%20Guide%20to%20Greedy%20Algorithms.pdf">Greedy Algorithms and their proofs</a></h3>
<p>Greedy proofs are probably one of the hardest things to grasp in this course. A greedy proof uses some heuristic to construct a solution to some sort of optimzation problem (maximize the output of something, minimize the weight of this graph, ...)</p>
<p>Once you come up with an algorithm, a proof goes as follows. This is called an <strong>exchange argument</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider the greedy solution that we came up with, Sg and consider an optimal solution S.</li>
<li>If S = Sg, clearly the greedy algorithm is optimal in this case. When S â‰  Sg, we compare the solutions. They must differ in some way, determine what and label these elements. In particular, some element in S might be replaced with some other element in Sg. Or two elements might have different ordering. Label these elements.</li>
<li>Exchange elements, showing some way to transform the optimal solution in one step so that it is closer to the greedy solution. The key here is that any step must not change the cost of the solution. During the exchange step, some problems might only have one optimal solution and so an exchange will lead to a contradiction, showing that the optimal solution S must be equal to Sg (this is uncommon though).</li>
<li>If we can iterate on each exchange until we reach the greedy solution, then we have proven that Sg is just a different optimal solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key ideas here are, to show that Sg produces a solution that is optimal. By showing that every optimal solution is just a rearrangement in some way with equal cost, we prove that the greedy solution is optimal.</p>
<p>An alternative approach with exchange arguments is to define the solution we're comparing to as an arbitrary solution, and show that by taking exchange steps that never increase the cost, and step towards the greedy solution in a provably finite number of steps, then we can say that the greedy solution is optimal. The key idea here is that by showing we can reach the greedy solution from EVERY solution using exchanges that never increase the cost, there must be no solution who's cost is less than the greedy solution to begin with.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h3>
<p>DP can be used to remove repeated recursive calls.</p>
<ul><li>linear independent set example &lt;= weighted activity selection &lt;= weighted independence set</li></ul>
<h3 id="graphs">Graphs</h3>
<p>Minimum Spanning Tree is a spanning tree (one that includes all vertices in a graph) who's sum of all edge weights is minimized (it is the spanning tree with lowest weight possible). Greedy approach gives us Prim's Algorithm, starting at any vertex, continuously add the edge with smallest weight, to a vertex not yet in the set of the MST.</p>
<p>Topological sorting DAGs takes O(m+n) using Kosaraju's Algorithm. Intuition is to DFS through the graph and label the order of arrival at leaves of the DAG. Then sort from largest to smallest to obtain the sorted list of vertices.</p>
<p>Shortest paths between points in a graph has many variations.</p>
<p>Shortest path in a DAG is O(n + m), Topological sort then iterative DP to find the shortest path to each point from a single start.</p>
<p>Shortest path in a non-negative weighted undirected graph, use Dijkstra's Algorithm, greedy O(m log m) approach.</p>
<p>Shortest path between two vertices, with possibly negative weights but no negative weight cycles, use Bellman Ford O(nm), iterative DP solution looking at paths P(k, i) where k is the destination, and i is the number of edges in the path.</p>
<p>For shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, there are O(n^2) vertex pairs (nC2), use <strong>Floyd-Warshall</strong>, O(n^3) algorithm, iterative DP looking at paths P(i, j, n) where i is source, j is dest, n is some intermediate node.</p>
<h3 id="intractability">Intractability</h3>
<p>Looking at problems that we do not know of any efficent algorithms for (SAT, 01 Knapsack, Travelling Salesman Problem)</p>
<ul><li>focus on decision problems: boolean output rather than optimization problems</li></ul>
<p>Let's formalize the set of tractable problems, "easy":</p>
<p>class P: given a computational decision probelm C, C is in P iff there exists an algorithm solving C in O(n^k) for constant k</p>
<p>pretty good definition in practice, but edges cases exist like n^1000 or exponential algorithms that run efficiently on average</p>
<p>Idea behind <strong>reduction</strong>: if you're trying to sell security software, you can't say that it not hackable, but you can argue that if your software is hacked, then every other piece of software is hacked too.</p>
<p>Looking at travelling salesperson problem, there is no known algorithm that can determine a tour in G in polynomial time. It's really hard to prove that there is absolutely no algorithm that exists. But we can prove that TSP is as difficult as a bunch of other unsolved problems.</p>
<p>How do we prove in a relative sense?</p>
<p>C1 <strong>reduces</strong> to C2 (C<sub>1</sub> &lt;=<sub>P</sub> C<sub>2</sub>) if given a polynomial time solution for C2, we can solve C1 in poly-time</p>
<p>We define <strong>completeness</strong> as, Let C be a set of problems, let ci in C b3 C-complete if forall ck in C, ck reduces to ci (ci is the hardest problem in C).</p>
<p>We can try to argue that TSP is the hardest problem in its class by saying that it is C-complete for a set of problems. This is C=NP. It is canonically the set of brute-force solvable problems.</p>
<p>Looking at the optimization version of the knapsack problem, it's clear that finding the max value also let's us simply solve the decision version of it.</p>
<p>C* is NP complete means</p>
<ol>
<li>Show C* in NP</li>
<li>Show every C in NP, C &lt;=<sub>P</sub> C* showing that C * is NP-hard</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-argue-a-problem-is-in-np">How to argue a problem is in NP</h3>
<p>Pick some set of problems C and show that C in NP if</p>
<ol>
<li>correct solutions have polynomial length</li>
<li>problem instane that have YES answers are verifiable in polynomial time, given a solution</li>
</ol>
<p>So all problems in P are also in NP.</p>
<p>So we have two ways to argue <code>C*</code> is NP-complete</p>
<h3 id="reduction-example">Reduction Example</h3>
<p>Remember, C1 reduces to C2 =&gt; C2 is as hard as C1</p>
<p>Prove that Independent Sets (IS) reduces to 3-SAT</p>
<p>IS says find some k vertices that have no edges between any of them</p>
<p>3-SAT says given a boolean expression in CNF, find an assignment to n variables that yields true for the whole expression.</p>
<p>Write a reduciton, a polynomial time coverter from an IS problem instance to a 3SAT problem instance.</p>
<ul><li>in this case, make an edge between two vars if they are joined by <code>and</code>, and also make an edge for any pair of vertices labelled <code>xi</code> and <code>not xi</code>
</li></ul>
<p>State that the reduction is polynomial time</p>
<p>Claim: F is satisfiable iff exists an IS, S in G of size &gt;= m (for m clauses in 3SAT)</p>
<p>Can there be an IS of size &gt; n?</p>
<p>Proof of Claim:</p>
<ol><li>Assume F is satisfiable. Prove there exists an IS S in G of sie exactly m.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>exists an assignment of vars that makes each clause Ci true</li>
<li>pick one vertex from each clause that makes it true, then the selected m vertices are independent because we picked one from each clause and we cannot have picked xi and <code>not xi</code> at the same time for any xi</li>
</ul>
<ol><li>If there as an IS, S in G, then F is satisfiable</li></ol>
<ul><li>then S contains exactly one vertex from each clause gadget Ci</li></ul>
<p>Prove that IS reduces to Vertex cover.</p>
<p>Vertex cover outputs yes iff exists subset S of vertices of size &lt;= k s.t. forall edges (u,v) in E, either u in S or v in S.</p>
<p>Write a reduction, notice that they are inverse problems in a sense: for solution S of vertices that covers all edges, then V - S is a solution for independent sets, since V - S cannot have any edges within in, otherwise S wouldn't have been a solution to vertex cover.</p>
<p>Claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>VC is NPC</li>
<li>VC is in NP (check that a given solution is correct by iterating through edges)</li>
<li>IS &lt;=p VC</li>
</ol>
<p>Prove that Clique is NPC</p>
<p>Clique is a set S subset of V, where all possible edges exist within S and S is of size &gt;= k.</p>
<p>Claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clique is NPC</li>
<li>Clique is NP</li>
<li>IS reduces to Clique</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that we can covert the problem by using the idea that a clique is exactly the opposite of an independent set. So we can just invert the edges of the graph and find a solution for Clique, and that is the solution for IS.</p>
<p>Subset-Sum reduces to 0-1 Knapsack</p>
<p>Instance converter:</p>
<pre><code>Subset Sum
X = {x1, ..., xn}, t

|
V
0/1 Knapsack
values = {x1, ..., xn}
weights = {x1, ..., xn}
W = t
V = t</code></pre>
<h3 id="np-complete-problems">NP-Complete Problems</h3>
<p>Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) decision version says is there some tour of a given complete graph whose total weight is less than k?</p>
<p>Hamiltonian Cycle is can we find a path that visits every vertex exactly once? This reduces to TSP by converting a graph instance to a complete graph with weights 0 for existing edges and 1 for non existing, then solve TSP less than 1.</p>
<p>0/1 knapsack decision problem finds out whether there is some subset of items (with weight and value) that can fit in a constrained weight backpack, with total value over k.</p>
<p>Independent set is the same problem we saw before for linear graphs, but generalized to all graphs. Output yes iff there exists a subset S of V of size greater than k s.t. no pair of vertices in S have an edge.</p>
<p>Vertex Cover outputs yes if there is a subset S of V vertices of size &gt; k, s.t. every edge has at least one end in S. This can be reduced easily to independent sets</p>
<h3 id="undecidability">Undecidability</h3>
<p>NP-Complete is a set of uniquely difficult problems, but not the most difficult by any means, just uniquely interesting to study. There are more difficult (complex classes) of algorithms. At the top are ones that are undecidable, not solvable.</p>
<p>Consider the Halting problem: design an algorithm that determines if a given algorithm and input data halts (terminates). If a program will get stuck in an infinite loop, it does not halt.</p>
<p>But this is undecidable. Consider a halting algorithm that exists. Then consider an algorithm that takes an algorithm as input (think compilers and this is reasonable). Then let H be our halting algorithm. If we design a self-referential algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>HSelf(x):
  if H(x, x) == yes: while true {}
  else halt</code></pre>
<p>Then the result of this program is a contradiction and here's why. Assume HSelf halts. Then <code>HSelf(HSelf)</code> should halt. But applying the halting program H, <code>H(HSelf, HSelf)</code> returns true. But then HSelf would enter an infinite loop by definition. The contradiction here is that if HSelf with this input is non-halting, even though we assumed it were halting. The logical conclusion of this statement is, <code>HSelf halts implies HSelf doesn't halt</code> which is a contradiciton.</p>
<p>Looking at the other case, assume HSelf doesn't halt. Then <code>HSelf(HSelf)</code> calls <code>H(HSelf, HSelf)</code> which returns false. <code>HSelf</code>'s implementation causes it to halt. The logical statement derived here is <code>HSelf doesn't halt implies HSelf halts</code>. This statemnt is a contradiciton.</p>
<p>Since both cases are contradictions, we can conclude that there cannot exist a halting algorithm.</p>
<p>This was proven using a paradox. If x, then not x style of logic. The idea is that we assume an algorithm for a problem exists, and show that if this were true, then for some input, every case reduces to a contradiction, allowing us to conclude that such an algorithm could never exist.</p>
<p>We can use reduction techniques from the last chapter to show other problems are undecidable. Show that we can phrase some undecidable problem in terms of some other problem (as a specific input or case of the problem), and this proves that this other algorithm must also be undecidable.</p>
