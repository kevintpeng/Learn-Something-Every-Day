# Genetics
- mendelian inheritance, how it relates to genotype, phenotype and alleles 
- differences of gene structure between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
- Drosophal
- when breeding, to figure out genotypes, we want to take pure bred Ps, cross to form F<sub>1</sub>, and cross F<sub>1</sub> to get F<sub>2</sub>, then inspect ratio to determine whether the trait is complete dominance (1:3), codominance (1:2:1), incomplete dominance (1:2:1), two genes interacting (9:3:3:1), complementary genes (9:7)

#### Introduction
Mendelian genetics, pedigree analysis is applied for humans
- **phenotype** is something we can see & observe (trait); end result rather than genetic representation
- **genotype**: genetic make up; description of the genetic information (what are the alleles that make it up)
- **progeny**: descendants
- Mendel's experiments with garden peas: **cross-fertilization/cross-pollination**
- anthers that contain pollen and cross-fertilize using pollen between purple and white (different phenotype) pea flowers
  - cross fertilizing weren't clones!
- **monohybrid crosses** come from pure breeds: ex. pure yellow pea and pure green pea
- breeding pures, they're called F<sub>1</sub> progeny, or first filial (monohybrids since only one trait has evolved)
- Discrete units of inheritance are **alleles** of genes, and are instances of a single gene
  - *hair colour* is the gene (object), black and brown are alleles (instances)
- diploid organisms means they only ever have two alleles for a given gene as a part of their DNA (more than one allele may exist among a population though)
- by convention, *genes* are written in italics
- **homozygous** means both alleles are the same for a gene vs. **heterozygous**
- **polymorphic** 
- **gametes** are the reproductive cells
- **Mendel's law of segregation**: two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation and unite at random during fertilization
- Peas are wrinkled based on whether they are soluble or not
  - starch active branching enzyme makes the starch insoluble, acting catalytically 
- **Dihybrid crosses** with respect to two genes have different alleles for both genes; come from two pure bred homozygous dominant and recessive parents respectively
- **Mendel's Law of Independent assortment**: during gamete formation, different pairs of alleles segregate independently of each other
- by summing genotypic ratios, we get the phenotypic ratios 1:2:1 and 9:3:3:1 for one and two genes respectively
- a **test cross** is used to find a genotype from a phenotype

### Mendelian
Genes can have incomplete dominance or codominanance, resulting in new phenotype ratios
- some genes might have multiple possible alleles, in which case you can determine a **dominance series** by crossing every combination of homozygotes
- **complementation** between two genes is when the phenotype changes if either of two genes has homozygous recessive (mutations in the same gene result in the same phenotypic offspring, while mutations in different genes results in the new phenotype in F1)
- **epistatic** is control over another gene
  - we see three phenotypes: one for both dominant, and two for at least one recessive phenotype (where only one shows through for both recessive) 
  - that is when F2 is homozygous recessive for the epistatic gene, then we see a new phenotype. The ratio is 9:3:4 for **recessive epistasis**
- **hypothesis testing** let's us use different breeding tests to decide between hypotheses
- genotype does not always dictate phenotype, sometimes environment influences it
- **pedigree analysis** allows us to track inheritance of human traits

### Mitosis -- Chapter 3
Interphase gap -- cells are activitly creating whatever they should be creating in the biological role
- individual form sister chromatids remain joined at the centromere
- metaphase chromosomes are either **metacentric or acrocentric** depending on the location of the centromere

Interphase Gap 2
- phase before mitosis, cells synthesize proteins for mitosis

**Mitosis:** Prophase


Mitosis: 
- Prophase
  - kinetochore is where microtubules of the spindle attach
- Metaphase -- metaphase plane is formed 
- Anaphase -- sister chromatids move to opposite poles, **disjunction**
- Telophase and cytokinesis 
  - animal, contractile ring squeezes creating the cleavage furrow to split cells 
  - plant, you have to lay down celulose at the cell plane to divide cells
  
unipartite, bipartite?

#### Meiosis 
Germ cells divide to produce gametes through meiosis.

Germ cells go through Meiosis. First the chromosomes go through duplication. 
- meiosis I is separation of chromosomes: 2n->n
  - centromere remains entact
  - homologous pairs will cross and swap genetic material
  
Prophase I:
- Leptotene, chromosomes condense
- Zygotene, chromosomes seek out homologous partner, so they line up. **Synaptonemal complex** form (protein structure that brings them together like a zipper)
  - **tetrad**s form from two homologous chromosomes pairs (4 chromatids total)
- Pachytene, **crossing over** is genetic exchange between non-sister chromatids of homologous pair, and get a hybrid between maternal and paternal
  - **recombination nodules** appear along the synaptonemal complex, facilitating DNA exchange (3-4 sites)
- Diplotene, synaptonemal complex dissolves
  - crossing over gives us independent assortment
- Diakinesis, separation occurs

Metaphase I:
- microtubules pulls chromosomes 

Anaphase I:

Meiosis II:
- Anaphase II, centromere breaks

Comparing:
- Mitosis for somatic cells, meiosis for germ cells (in the sexual cycle)
- Mitosis duplicates identitcal cells, Meiosis facilitates cross-over and exchange of genetic material
- Mitosis is one stage, Meiosis is two stages of division (since haploid cells are the results)

**Oogenesis** is egg formation in humans. The egg need lots of cytoplasm with mitochondria
- start with diploid cells (divided through mitosis) 
- *is like meiosis but three of the four haploids produced disintegrate in what we call* **polar bodies**
- create a **secondary oocyte** 
  - undergoes another round of meiosis
- store oocytes in ovaries arrested at prophase I diplotene after corssing over, and release mature haploid oocytes after puberty
  - ovum and sperm fuse to form the diploid zygote (formation of two gametes)
  - since oocytes are suspended at prophase I, with microtubules attached to kinetochores, there may be segregation errors as they degrade resulting in a trisomy 
  
Looking at Drisophila:  
- **Hemizygous** for a particular chromosome means you only have one copy of the allele.
- **Nondisjunction** occurs when an error in Meiosis causes X chromosomes in females to not separate uniformly, so two end up together in one egg and nullo-X in the other
- **chromosomal theory of inheritance** is affirmed, and the conclusion is that genes reside on specific chromosomes, genes determine traits 
- Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that crisscross inheritance occurs in X-linked traits (mother passes to son, father passes to daughter)
  - XXX dies usually since 

### Changes in Chromosome Number

Aneuploidy - individual whose chromsome number is not a multiple of `n`
- Monosomic 2n -1
- Trisomic 2n + 1
- Tetrasomic 2n + 2 four copies of a given chromosome

Autosomal aneuploidy is generally lethal
- chromosome 1 and 2 are large so almost always lethal
- Trisomy 21 is tolerated well since it is a small chromosome
- Nondisjunction of hommight happen after cross over has occurred in meiosis I, in which case we get two diplo-21 gametes and two nullo-21
- nondisjunction after Meiosis II, we get two normal, one diplo-21, one nullo-21 and thus one trisomy, and two normal, one monosomy

Aneuploidy for the X chromosome
- **X-inactivation**, all but one X chromosome is repressed, otherwise females will have all genes expressed twice
  - happens randomly per cell
  - Bar body is the condensed inactive X
  - tendency to clonally keep the same X off
  - calico multi-coloured cats are a result of inactivation of random X's, for codominant alleles
  
Sex Chromosome Aneuploidy
- XXX 1:1000, normal
- XO (one X) 1:2500 Turner's Syndrome 
- XXY 1:500 Klinefelter Syndrome
- XYY
- OY: lethal

Kleinfelter's results from non-disjunction in female in Meiosis I or Meiosis II

Kleinfelter's results from non-disjunction in males in only Meiosis I.

**Aneuploid mosaics** like Turner's Syndrome result from mitotic nondisjunction
- the centromere doesn't split so we can end up with a trisomic cell and monosomic cell
- lagging chromatid at anaphase can be lost and cause monosomic cells 
- Turner's syndrome only works if you are an aneuploid mosaic

**Gynandromorph** is a special case where nondisjunction occurs in the first mitosis division.

**Euploids** contain only complete sets of chromosomes
- **Polyploids** carry three or more complete sets of chromosomes (more gene expression)
- **Monoploids** are organsims which have one complete set of set, and are generally infertile
- Note "somic" => aneuploid, "ploid" => euploid

Whiptail lizards are only females.

Polyploids (like Triploids and Tetraploids) are almost always sterile, since during cell division, chromatids do not segregate correctly
- Salmon can segragate correctly since they tag maternal and paternal

### Linkage and Recombination 
If genes are on different chromosomes, they will assort independently
- but if two genes are close together on a chromosome, they will be **linked** and **recombination** will be rare
- **parental phenotype** are the same exhibited phenotypes as either pure bred parent (in dihybrid crosses)
- **recombinant/nonparental phentotypes** are parts of the parents
- mendel's law of independent assortment predicts that in the dihybrid cross, all 4 phenotypes will occur with ratio 1:1:1:1
  - if genes are linked, we'll get more than 50% parentals, and vise versa
  - the more recombinants, the further apart the genes are on a chromosome
- |recombinants| ≤ |parental|

To keep track of parental allelic combinations, we can represent genotypes:
- vg b / vg<sup>+</sup> b<sup>+</sup>, rather than vg vg<sup>+</sup> b<sup>+</sup> b to hold more information
- take the F1 female and cross with an all recessive male to determine parental : recombinant ratio
  - we choose recessive male when testing with F1 since we don't want their traits to show
- if we only look at the males, then the male parent genotype doesn't matter

The Chi Square Test is a statistical test to evaluate hypotheses that two genes assort independently 
- basically to determine how statistically significant an outcome is
- apply an null hypothesis of no linkage

1. Use the data from an experiment, to determine total number of offspring and classes, and the given distribution 
2. Calculate the expected number (based on 1:1 ratio for null hypothesis).
3. &Chi;^2 = ∑ (observed - expected)^2/expected
4. Determine the degrees of freedom (df) = number of classes - 1
5. Use the chi-square value and number of degrees of freedom to determine a `p value` = probability that a deviation from the predicted numbers at least as large as that observed in the experiment will occur by chance
6. Evaluate the significance of the p value. **0.05 p value** is the boundary between accepting and rejecting null hypothesis
  - p=0.05 corresponds to two standard deviations
  - p value that's high means that there is a higher probability that the result was due to chance

Recombination was demonstrated using **physical markers** that were visible under the mircoscope. In the example, there was discontinuity and a bend.
- using **recombination frequency** as the percentage, we can measure it using **mapping units**
- by convention, `ry / Ry ; tV / Tv` is notation for maternal / paternal and semi colon indicates different chromosomes
- recombination frequencies of 50% indicates either not on the same chromosome, or they're really far apart on the same 
  - we can discern between the two by looking at each linkage with a gene between them

Two Point Crosses
- Limitation is that mapping units are less accurate when genes are far apart, due to high variance

Three Point crosses
- double crossovers messes up the data, since crosses can occur without changing the gamete class
- 2^3 = 8 different genotypes
- highest two are the parents, always
- second two highest are single crossovers in the largest region I, SCOI
- third highest two are single crossovers in the smaller region II, SCOII
- last two will be double crossovers, one in each region, DCO

- Next, for all pairs two genes, sum all the recombinants (ignoring the third) and multiply by 100 to get m.u.
- using m.u. we can determine order
- finally, we add the number of DCO  **twice** (since two crossovers occur) to the pair of genes with the farthest m.u. to account for the error messing up the map units, since we don't get a recombinant phenotype
