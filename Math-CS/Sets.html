<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>
<p>A <em>set</em> is an unordered colleciton of distinct objects. The objects in a set are <em>elements</em> or <em>members</em>.</p>
<p>Fields like the Natural numbers, Integers or Real numbers are all sets defined like {0,1,2, ...}.</p>
<h4 id="operations">Operations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Union. A ∪ B = {x : x in A or x in B}</li>
<li>Intersection. A ∩ B = {x : x in A and x in B}</li>
<li>Difference. A \ B = {x : x in A and ¬ in B}</li>
<li>Can be extended to multiple sets (like large sum notation ∑)</li>
<li>Cardinality |A| is the <em>size</em> of A, number of elements.</li>
<li>Subset. A ⊆ B = { for all x in A, x in B}</li>
</ul>
<p>Two sets are disjoint if they share no elements, or whose intersection is the empty set ø. A family of sets is pairwise disjoint if for any two sets A and B are disjoint.</p>
<h4 id="notation">Notation</h4>
<p>For sets A and B, A x B is a cartesian product, with the identity |A x B| = |A||B| (actually like a product of sets). Can be extended to say B^A to mean the set of all functions that map from A-&gt;B: { f: A -&gt; B }</p>
<p>So the total number of possible functions is |B| possibilities |A| times for each element <code>a</code> in A. So <code>|B^A| = |B|^|A|</code></p>
<p>R^2 is the two dimensional space (from linear algebra), or the set of all tuples of real numbers. This can be re-written as <code>R^{0,1}</code>. That is, the set of functions that map <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> to two Real numbers respectively. (3.14, -5) could be represented as f(0) = 3.14, f(1) = -5, f in R^2.</p>
<h5 id="set-of-all-subsets">Set of All Subsets</h5>
<p><strong>The power set</strong> of A is the set of all subsets, denoted by <code>2^A</code>. It can be thought of as <code>{0,1}^A</code>, the set of all functions that map an element a in A to either 1 or 0. That is, for every element <code>a</code> in A, we can either include it or exclude it, giving us 2 possiblities per element and 2^|A| subsets in total. Useful as a filter: f(a) = { 1 if a is allowed by f, 0 if not } where <code>2^A</code> is the set of all subsets of A. This also works nicely with cardinality: |2^A| = 2^|A|</p>
