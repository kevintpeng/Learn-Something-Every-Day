<p>Set of many algorithms for completing the task of grouping objects with similiar properties</p>
<ul>
<li>popular notion of a cluster is a group with a small distance among the members, dense areas of the data space, or particular distributions</li>
<li>can be phrased as a multi-objective optimization problem</li>
<li>not an automated task, it's iterative knowledge discovery</li>
<li>cluster is ambiguous in definition, and thus there are many algorithms for the various models of clustering</li>
<li>clustering can be classified as hard clustering (all objects belong to a cluster) or soft (may not belong to a cluster)</li>
</ul>
<p>Classifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>in strict partitioning, each object belongs to exactly one cluster. With outliers, some objects can belong to none</li>
<li>overlapping clustering, objects may belong to more than one cluster</li>
<li>hierarchical clustering, objects belong to nested sub-clusters, based on variable distance (often euclidean)</li>
<li>subspace clustering is a type of overlapping clustering, with strict clustering for a uniquely defined subspace</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="connectivity-based-clustering-hierarchical">Connectivity-Based Clustering (Hierarchical)</h4>
<p>Based on the assumption that objects in the set that are near each other in terms of distance are more related than those that are far</p>
<ul>
<li>single clusters can be described by the distance between the furthest two points in the set</li>
<li>provides multiple clusters based on the distance function</li>
<li>choice of linkage clustering affects how clusters are chosen<ul><li>linkage function describes the distance between clusters</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Dendrograms</strong> are used to represent cluster hierarchies<ul><li>shows how clusters form as you adjust distance</li></ul>
