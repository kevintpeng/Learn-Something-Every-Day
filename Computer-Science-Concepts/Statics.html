<p>Static methods are procedural code. In object-orient programming, mixing in procedural code can make it difficult to test</p>
<ul>
<li>dependencies are other objects that are passed in to an object, which makes calls on its dependencies</li>
<li>in unit testing, dependencies can be mocked so that parts of appications can be instantiated without needing to always test full integration with all its dependencies</li>
<li>calls to static methods cannot be mocked because they are not instance methods so there is no underlying object to mock<ul><li>once a <code>new</code> operator is called directly, that object cannot be mocked in testing</li></ul>
</li>
<li>the <strong>factory method design pattern</strong> is one common way to avoid this, when instantiating objects in code<ul><li>to be clear, this is where a factory is an object, with an instance method <code>Create</code>. Not a static method that acts as a factory</li></ul>
