<p>The act of providing a single interface to entities of different data types (objects for example). A <strong>polymorphic type</strong> is a data type whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type.</p>
<h3 id="ad-hoc-polymorphism">Ad Hoc Polymorphism</h3>
<p>Where polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types (often through function overloading). <code>+</code> can be used like <code>1 + 3.7 = 4.7</code> or <code>int + float = float</code>. It also overloaded in some languages to do <code>"bab" + "oon" = "baboon"</code>.</p>
<h3 id="parametric-polymorphism">Parametric Polymorphism</h3>
<p>Non type specific code, called <em>generics</em>.</p>
<h3 id="subtyping">Subtyping</h3>
<p>When a name denotes instances of many different subclasses of a superclass (polymorphism in OOP).</p>
<h1 id="dynamic-dispatch">Dynamic Dispatch</h1>
<p>A feature of The process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation to call at run time. A prime characteristic of object oriented programming languages. It is desirable to name multiple methods with the same name, whose functionality is similar, but operate on multiple types.</p>
<p><em>Static dispatch</em>, the implementation of a polymorphic operation is selected at compile-time. Dynamic dispatch provides support for cases where the appropriate implementation cannot be determined at compile time, because it depends on the runtime type.</p>
<h3 id="single-and-multiple-dispatch">Single and Multiple Dispatch</h3>
<p>The decision of which version of a method to called can be based on a single object or many objects. <strong>Single dispatch</strong> is supported by OOP languages like smalltalk, C++, ruby, where the object itself. Multiple dispatch is a generalized form of single dispatch, where functions are dispatched based on multiple objects.</p>
