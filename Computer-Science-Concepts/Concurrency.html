<h2 id="synchronous-programming-model">Synchronous Programming Model</h2>
<p>For a list of tasks, thread is assigned a task, completes task, starts new taskâ€¦</p>
<p>Single thread completes them like a queue. Multi-threaded, each thread completes task.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-programming-model">Asynchronous Programming Model</h2>
<p>For tasks, a single thread can hold the state of a task, complete another task and resume original.</p>
<p><strong>Concurrency</strong> is when multiple requests are being processed at a time.</p>
<h1 id="multithreading">Multithreading</h1>
<p>Programs can run multiple threads, carrying out multiple tasks at once. For ruby, its <code>Thread.new do ...</code></p>
<p>Multithreading can maximize performance of a program by taking advantage of multi-core hardware. It is called <strong>Parallel Computing</strong> and can drastically improve performance, and in extreme examples with distributed systems can complete intensive tasks that would be otherwise unreasonable.</p>
<p>Multithreading and Asynchronous programming are separate concepts. <strong>Multi-threading can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous models.</strong> Multiple threads can work on a single queue of tasks, as in the synchronous model. In the asynchronous model, multiple threads can work on entirely independent tasks, like waiting for user input, reading a database, computing a task etc...</p>
<h1 id="io-concurrency-models">I/O Concurrency Models</h1>
<p>Concurrency describes the concept of running several tasks at once.</p>
<h3 id="single-threaded-multi-process">Single-threaded Multi-process</h3>
<p>Each process handles exactly one request at a time. The web server load balances between processes. Not suitable for long-running blocking I/O workloads (workloads that call HTTP APIs).</p>
<h3 id="multi-threaded-single-process">Multi-threaded Single-Process</h3>
<p>Multi-threading allows high I/O concurrency, good for both short-running and long-running blocking I/O workloads. Prone to concurrency bugs.</p>
<h3 id="evented">Evented</h3>
<p>Different than previous two, allows very high I/O concurrency. Rails does not support evented code. Javascript uses evented concurrency.</p>
<h3 id="race-conditionhazard">Race Condition/Hazard</h3>
<p>Behaviour of systems where the output is dependent on the sequence/timing of events. Originates from circuits.</p>
<ul>
<li>affects multi-threaded or multi-process software, that share persistent components</li>
<li>an operation that is <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> cannot be interrupted while accessing a resource</li>
<li>for file systems, file locking is common to avoid this<ul><li>software generally requests and reserves all resources it will need before a task</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mutual-exclusion">Mutual Exclusion</h3>
<p>Mutual Exclusion is the requirement of ensuring no two concurrent processes are accessing critical sections at the same time</p>
<p>Removing two nodes i and i+1 at the same time results in i+1 not being removed:<br>
