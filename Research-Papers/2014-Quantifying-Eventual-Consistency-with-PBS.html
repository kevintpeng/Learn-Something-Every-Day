<p>In general, a quorum is the minimal number of people that need be present in order to make the preceeding of a meeting valid. In quorum replication, there are N replicas.</p>
<ul>
<li>a write quorum waits for W acknowledgements from replicas</li>
<li>read quorum, consult R of the replicas and return the most recent value from the read quorum</li>
<li>a quorum system describes the powerset of replicas</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamo and Cassandra are examples of data stores that depend on quorum systems for consistency</p>
<ul>
<li>strong consistency is achieved when a quorum is equal to the majority of replicas</li>
<li>partial quorums allow sets of replicas that may not overlap, but have eventual consistency</li>
<li>employ quorum system for each key (for lots of cases, a quorum system for strong consistency would all sets of majority size)</li>
<li>for N replication factor, different quorum systems can be used depending on how critical the underlying data is<ul>
<li>Cassandra default is N=3 R=1 W=1</li>
<li>for mission critical/financial data, Rias default is N=3 R=2 W=2 (majorities achieve strong consistency)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>partial quorums are used (controversially) by many, to achieve low latency and high availability</li>
<li>this paper bounds the behaviour of the system, for the chance of stale reads<ul>
<li>intuitively chance of overlap is inversely proportional to staleness of data</li>
<li>use probabilistic bound for staleness (<strong>Probabilistically Bounded Staleness</strong> PBS)</li>
<li>useful for analyzing effectiveness of eventual consistency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in a probabilistic sense, we look at a quorum system (a set), and look at which sets in the set would result in stale data</li>
<li>in other words, N-W is the set with stale values, so "choose R from N-W" combinations resulting in a stale read</li>
</ul>
