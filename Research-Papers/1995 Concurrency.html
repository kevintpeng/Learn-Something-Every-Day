<ul>
<li>code generation that are correct for sequential programs may have incorrect semantics for concurrent programs</li>
<li>solutions that make correctness guarantees state potentially unreasonable requirements for the library designer and end programmer<ul>
<li>by forbidding optimization, performance gains are lessened, which is often the reason for concurrency in the first place</li>
<li>requiring explicit deactivation of optimizations requires deep knowledge of the compiler, its optimizations, and may result is wildly different behaviour and correctness guarantees depending on the compiler implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the conclusion of this paper is that concurrency is a linguistic feature that affects code generation</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>compiler loads variables into a register, then data modification doesn't get written back to the variable as needed and other threads won't see the changes<ul><li>Dekker's and Petersons' algorthims (software solutions) use assignment</li></ul>
</li>
<li>compiler might reorder instructions for optimization, which may cause reordering at the boundaries of critical sections<ul><li>requires explicit language facilities (<code>volatile</code>) or concurrency constructs to disable optimization</li></ul>
</li>
<li>instruction substitution (for multiple) can turn atomic operations into non-atomic operations</li>
</ol>
