<ul><li><a href="#takeaways">Takeaways</a></li></ul>
</div>
<p>TFX is Google's platform for machine learning</p>
<ul><li>models are described in TensorFlow</li></ul>
<p>The platform aims for reliability, automated data validation, respecting data errors</p>
<ul>
<li>user defined schemas allow for data validation, making assertions about data quality (types, presence, valency/range of values) and throwing errors appropriately</li>
<li>anomaly detection is important for data quality, based on defined schemas or potentially inferred</li>
<li>it's important that users feel like data isn't missing and that it's relevant</li>
<li>providing statistics on features is important for users to be able to understand their data before using it (geolocation heat map, histograms, standard deviation, etc...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Model validation is ensuring that the model shipped to production is safe and has desired prediction quality</p>
<ul>
<li>should not crash, consume too many resources</li>
<li>human-facing metrics from A/B testing is effective for large changes, but is costly and takes time</li>
<li><p>machine</p></li>
<li><p>Google Play was a use case, continuous model training improved install rates due to recency and relevance of the model</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>data transformations must be applied consistently to both to pipeline data and online data (going directly to the trained model)</li>
<li>continuous model training allows more up to date predictions</li>
</ul>
