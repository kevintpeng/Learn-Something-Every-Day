<p>Serverless is a "next-gen" platform as a service model where the service provider handles capacity planning, task scheduling, and operating the cluster. Clients send functions to be executed and pay only for the duration of execution</p>
<ul>
<li>further, the application developer, in the example of a webserver, need not handle socket listening and task dispatching and are only responsible for the logic of processing an event</li>
<li>AWS lambda runs containers, and manages creation and deletion<ul><li>containers are tried to be reused for subsequent function calls (since creation can have latency times in the seconds)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>economic benefit comes from jobs that need to only run periodically need not reserve resources while idle</li>
<li>one implication is that implicit trust between sequential requests is lost (no gatekeeper so everything request must be authenticated)<ul><li>increased latency for traditional design, and requires a different concept of distributed authentication</li></ul>
</li>
<li>serverless architecture removes economic incentives for bundling logic into single applications</li>
<li>running multiple versions has no extra cost in serverless architecture since the number of requests remains the same</li>
</ul>
