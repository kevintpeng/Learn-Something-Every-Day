<p>The fundamental goal of machine learning is to construct a function that can generalize beyond examples in the training data</p>
<ul>
<li>a learning problem can abstractly be broken down into three components: Representation Evaluation Optimization<ul><li>components can be combined in order to find a fit learning algorithm for some use case</li></ul>
</li>
<li>error in learning can be categorized as bias or variance<ul>
<li>bias is tightly producing the wrong results consistently, this is a result of overfitting</li>
<li>variance is producing results that are close to correct, but with low accuracy</li>
<li>Overfitting - the learner should perform equally against testing data and new data, otherwise it is overfit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>every learner must have underlying assumptions and knowledge of the data, because no learner can generalize beyond the training data for random boolean functions<ul><li>
<em>No free lunch theorem</em> implies that a learning algorithms can't beat random guessing for random vector functions</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Multi testing problem - so many hypotheses tests that it is statistically probable that there are anomalies<ul><li>this can be mitigated by applying weighting to account for high volumes of hypothesis tests</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
