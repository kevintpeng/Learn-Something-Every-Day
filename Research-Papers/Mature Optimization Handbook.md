*The trickiest part of speeding up a program is not doing it, but deciding whether it's worth doing at all.*

### Defining the problem
Before optimzation, you need a measure of efficiency. **Walltime** describes physical time (like a clock on the wall). Walltime is from computation on CPU and time spent waiting for data from storage or network.
