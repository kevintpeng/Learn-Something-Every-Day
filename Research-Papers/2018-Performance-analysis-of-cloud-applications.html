<p>Stated that the only way to analyze production performance is using live production systems. In this paper, Google looks at Gmail performance</p>
<ul>
<li>looking at request patterns with respect to time, you can find cyclical patterns in user activity based on what kind of app you are running</li>
<li>load can be composed of user activity and one-off events like recoveries, jobs, deploys</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="methodology-for-live-testing">Methodology for live testing</h3>
<p>Users are partitioned randomly, one test and one control</p>
<ul>
<li>A/B testing is common for UI changes</li>
<li>A/A testing is used to measure statistical deviation in user partitions (without necessarily rolling out new features between the two partitions)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="statistics-and-experiments">Statistics and experiments</h3>
<p>Must make assumptions clear when using statistics and scrutinize the experiment to enure that assumptions (like event independence) are not violated</p>
<h3 id="measuring-performance">Measuring Performance</h3>
<p>Before determining how to make an app faster, we must understand why it's slow or expensive</p>
<p><strong>temporal context</strong> of a request can be used to find out what else was running at the time</p>
<p><strong>operation context</strong> tells you how a request ran (what parameters, maybe what other calls are madE)</p>
<p>We need a method for tracing the context of these events. <em>it seems temporal context may be as easy as timestamps when estimating?</em> More accurately, we might require coordination between layers</p>
