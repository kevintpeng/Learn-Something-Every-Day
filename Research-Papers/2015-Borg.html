<p>orchestration software system, for managing clusters of machines for performing tasks and jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>provides a system for allocating resources for future tasks, and setting priorities in the case of running out of resources</li>
<li>each borg cell has a borgmaster and a separate scheduler (for 10k+ machines)<ul><li>Borg master acts as a single process, but is backed up using replication, where information is kept with Paxos</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Borgmaster receives jobs and tasks in a priority queue, which is asynchronously read by the scheduler</li>
<li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/17af/beaad2aea3189cec58939f76718cd97d30fe.pdf?_ga=2.218917593.1326100776.1504734464-95379282.1504734464">scheduling algorithm</a></li>
<li>borglets are local agents on every machine, that start and stop tasks on machines, used for monitoring uptime and statistics, and expose HTTP endpoint</li>
<li>the borgmaster scheme scales through being distributed, implementing priority score caching, and randomization of which machines to score (only scoring a subset)</li>
<li>jobs in borg were inflexible (especially for multi-job semantics), so kubernetes organizes by pods using labels -- arbitrary key value pairs that users attach to any object, to allow sets of pods to be references</li>
<li>kubernetes has one ip address per pod (instead of machine), avoiding port conflicts and management</li>
<li>linux namespaces are the kernel feature that facilitate containerization and allow single IP addresses for each pod</li>
<li>pods are an extension of allocs, achieving the similar idea of assigned resources (useful for the logsaver pattern, with a side process for web server logs)</li>
<li>the Kubernetes architecture improves upon borg, breaking the master into an API server responsible for processing requests and the cluster management logic into micro-services (including replication controller and node controllers)</li>
