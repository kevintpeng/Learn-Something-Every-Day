<p>Rather than classes, prototype-oriented languages do inheritance by copying another object (the prototype) and adding attributes and methods to it; objects inherit from other objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Objects are generally completely mutable during runtime, unlike many class based object-oriented systems like Ruby.</li>
<li>generally interpreted and dynamically typed</li>
<li>objects inherit directly from other objects through a prototype property</li>
<li>object contruction can happen <strong>ex nihilo</strong> or through <strong>cloning</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delegation</strong> is a language feature. Delegates are like function pointers, allowing you to invoke a piece of code that is not known until runtime.</p>
<ul><li>in languages that use delegation, the runtime is capable of dispatching the correct method by following a series of delegation pointers from object to its prototype until a match is found</li></ul>
<p>In <strong>pure/concatenative</strong> prototyping, there are no pointers to the prototype</p>
<ul><li>changes to the prototype are not reflected in the cloned objects</li></ul>
