<h3 id="late-game-ideas">Late Game ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://lichess.org/2UlPxH5d/black#84">2vs1 pawn ending</a>: defender should try to force backwards pawn, simplifying to 1 v 1 passed pawns. If the attacker with two pawns can force an exchange, then it simplifies to a single passed pawn for the attacker. The defender wants to force a backwards pawn as far up the board as possible.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://lichess.org/dxsNAjna/black#55">Pinning a bishop to a rook with a rook</a>: locks two pieces down, as long as you don't leave a minor piece unprotected for the rook to attack.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://lichess.org/dxsNAjna/black#99">Missed Winning end Game</a>: against doubled pawn, could pin the front double pawn so it can't be used as a defender.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://lichess.org/dQOTA67N/white#40">White London</a>: had lead of two pawns, and a protected passed pawn. Was looking for a tactic here, should have been looking to hold and trade down.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://lichess.org/rKQDvg7l/white#54">Missed Winning End Game</a>: should take the 3vs2 queen side pawns, double pawns are enough to stop the advancing pawns</li>
<li>
<a href="https://lichess.org/WT43k1Do/white#56">White London System</a>: Don't need to defend their passed isolated pawn with both rook and king. Their two weaknesses on each side is enough pressure to stop any advances.</li>
