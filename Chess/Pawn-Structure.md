# Pawn Structure
One of the five elements of chess, they form the basis of where pieces want to reside, and further dictate where attacks should happen.

### Minority Attack
Term for a plan involving an exchange of pawns in favour of the side with fewer. The idea is to trade in order to create either a backwards pawn or an isolated pawn.

### Central Pawns
When a player achieves pawns in the center, their plan must try to reinforce them, otherwise they become targets.
- [In this exercise](https://lichess.org/analysis/rnbqk1nr/bpp2ppp/p2p4/8/3PPP2/5N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R_w_Kq_-_0_1), whites plan is to guard the center, while black needs to try to break it open first.

### Game Analysis
- [London System](https://lichess.org/C3AepJD6/white#26): should have pushed the c-pawn making it a passed pawn. The key here is that the opposing c-pawn AND b-pawn have been traded off. This move cements the c-pawn as a protected passed pawn, and creates an outpost for the bishop on d5.
