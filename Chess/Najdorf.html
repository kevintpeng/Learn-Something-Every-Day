<ul><li>idea is to protect the king from any future queenside attacks, and this buys us a lot of time to develop before needing to castle</li></ul>

But a pre-emptive e5 push can be met with Bb5+ with no good blocking move<ul><li>if you block with Bd7, you lose the light squared bishop and then the d5 square becomes an outpost for the knight (good knight bad bishop)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>but we cannot allow white to play Nf5, which attacks our weak backward d6 pawn and g7 pawn<ul><li>d5 can sometimes counter an early Nc5, thereby undermining it by attacking the defender and attacking the knight with our bishop</li></ul>
</li>
<li>whites Bg5 and Bc4 prevent us from playing e5, because white can immediately respond with Nc5</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>the main line that avoids the Najdorf is Nc3, called the closed sicilian. One idea is to transition to a king-side fianchetto, which controls the center</li></ul>

<li>in a position with opposite side castles, a fast attack/initiative is a more important imbalance than material</li>
<li>it is important not to give up initiative if you have a g6 or h6 pawn</li>
