# End Games 
### Late Game ideas
- [2vs1 pawn ending](https://lichess.org/2UlPxH5d/black#84): defender should try to force backwards pawn, simplifying to 1 v 1 passed pawns. If the attacker with two pawns can force an exchange, then it simplifies to a single passed pawn for the attacker. The defender wants to force a backwards pawn as far up the board as possible.
- [Pinning a bishop to a rook with a rook](https://lichess.org/dxsNAjna/black#55): locks two pieces down, as long as you don't leave a minor piece unprotected for the rook to attack.
- [Missed Winning end Game](https://lichess.org/dxsNAjna/black#99): against doubled pawn, could pin the front double pawn so it can't be used as a defender.

### Put up a stronger defense late game
- [White London](https://lichess.org/dQOTA67N/white#40): had lead of two pawns, and a protected passed pawn. Was looking for a tactic here, should have been looking to hold and trade down.
- [Missed Winning End Game](https://lichess.org/rKQDvg7l/white#54): should take the 3vs2 queen side pawns, double pawns are enough to stop the advancing pawns
- [White London System](https://lichess.org/WT43k1Do/white#56): Don't need to defend their passed isolated pawn with both rook and king. Their two weaknesses on each side is enough pressure to stop any advances.
