### Put up a stronger defense late game
- [White London](https://lichess.org/dQOTA67N/white#40): had lead of two pawns, and a protected passed pawn. Was looking for a tactic here, should have been looking to hold and trade down.
- [Missed Winning End Game](https://lichess.org/rKQDvg7l/white#54): should take the 3vs2 queen side pawns, double pawns are enough to stop the advancing pawns
- [White London System](https://lichess.org/WT43k1Do/white#56): Don't need to defend their passed isolated pawn with both rook and king. Their two weaknesses on each side is enough pressure to stop any advances.
