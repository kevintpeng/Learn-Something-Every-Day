- [White London](https://lichess.org/DLDK9AGI/white#18): Knight on c3 exchange, needed to force bishop takes first
- [White London](https://lichess.org/DLDK9AGI/white#12): missed tactic for two pawns
- [Black Sicilian](https://lichess.org/Wzv19IhK/black#45): Missed Queen Trap. Should have calculated their options better.
