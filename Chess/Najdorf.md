# Najdorf Sicilian
- idea is to protect the king from any future queenside attacks, and this buys us a lot of time to develop before needing to castle

### [What to do with the e-pawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zQCI0G5CaM&t=1s&ab_channel=ChessCoachAndras)
- [e5 push to the center](https://lichess.org/analysis/rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R_w_KQkq_-_0_1) is ideal for controlling the center. The ideal is d5 & e5. But a pre-emptive e5 push can be met with Bb5+ with no good blocking move
  - if you block with Bd7, you lose the light squared bishop and then the d5 square becomes an outpost for the knight (good knight bad bishop)
- but we cannot allow white to play Nf5, which attacks our weak backward d6 pawn and g7 pawn
  - d5 can sometimes counter an early Nc5, thereby undermining it by attacking the defender and attacking the knight with our bishop
- whites Bg5 and Bc4 prevent us from playing e5, because white can immediately respond with Nc5

### Anti-Sicilian
- the main line that avoids the Najdorf is Nc3, called the closed sicilian. One idea is to transition to a king-side fianchetto, which controls the center

### General Sicilian ideas as black
- [b5 mid game "gambit"](https://lichess.org/analysis/r2r2k1/p2bbpp1/2nppn1p/qp6/4PP1B/2NB1N2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R3R%20w%20-%20-%200%2014), to also open the b-file for a queenside attack, can generate some initiative for black
  - in a position with opposite side castles, a fast attack/initiative is a more important imbalance than material
  - it is important not to give up initiative if you have a g6 or h6 pawn
