# Controlling the Center
Very important principle of chess. The center is the key focus of all openings either directly in the form of seizing it or indirectly by applying pressure on it. Once held, a player can convert it into a flexible attack where we can either attack the kingside, queenside or center of the board. A player who controls the center can often apply enough pressure to achieve these positions where the opponent has very few options because they have so many areas of the board to defend at once.

### Common Center Ideas
- queenside castle if the d-file is semi-open, it saves a tempo.
- pushing pawns to the 5th rank when they're protected well. They can dominate space and prevent opposing pawns from entering the center, or they can perform an effective break. 
- knights in the center allow them to control the entire board.
- 4th rank bishops are at their strongest, claiming 7 squares of space in the enemy half.
- rarely, the queen can be strong in the middle if there are no good tempo-gaining development moves for the opponent.
