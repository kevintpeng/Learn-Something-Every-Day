### Recognize Positions Where Progress Cannot Be Made Quickly
- [White London](https://lichess.org/cyeP8QBB/white#32): did not recognize position where enemy could not make progress. Here you should move all your pieces to their optimal positions instead of worrying about pushing tempo.
- [White London](https://lichess.org/rKQDvg7l/white#16): in London, eyes on the e5 square as an outpost for the knight. Here missed opportunity to block dark-squared bishop, or exchange, winning the bishop pair. Knight can't take first because it leads to a minor piece fork.
- [Black QID](https://lichess.org/3mKjE6FJ/black#23): after minor pieces are developed, push for center control before rooks.
- [White London](https://lichess.org/eZGhhtgA/white#12): missed free rook with bishop on long diagonal
- [Black Najdorf](https://lichess.org/kZofv8hB/black#35): pre-emptive defensive move, weakening king pawn structure. Need to calculate more.
- [White London](https://lichess.org/1oMjdrdd/white#32): pre-emptive defensive move, weakening king pawn structure. 

### Opening Ideas
- [White London](https://lichess.org/XabOt7HN/white#16): should avoid the three separated pawn chains. It's better to try to open the h-file instead of the g-file with an isolated h-pawn.
- [Black QID](https://lichess.org/0DqPASJa/black#15): need to watch for light-squared bishop attack, blocking with knight has been problematic over a few games.
- [White London](https://lichess.org/0qIMkeTT/white#18): in this game, black tries to push an early queenside attack, we miss the move a3 shutting it down. We would be up a pawn, convert the a pawn to a more central pawn, and recapture the space advantage on the queenside with good dynamic play on the kingside.
- [Black Closed Sicilian](https://lichess.org/7xso3TZU/black#11): wins two pawns and keeps them passed. Notice that Ne4 here opens up the fork on f2 if Queens exchange.
- [Black Sicilian](https://lichess.org/edD1VVlL/black#9): 4th rank queen forks.
- [White London](https://lichess.org/xXfmHl63/white#10): often times, blocking the queen attack on b2 with our queen is fine
