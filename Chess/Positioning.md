- [White London](https://lichess.org/cyeP8QBB/white#32): did not recognize position where enemy could not make progress. Here you should move all your pieces to their optimal positions instead of worrying about pushing tempo.
- [White London](https://lichess.org/rKQDvg7l/white#16): in London, eyes on the e5 square as an outpost for the knight. Here missed opportunity to block dark-squared bishop, or exchange, winning the bishop pair. Knight can't take first because it leads to a minor piece fork.
- [Black QID](https://lichess.org/3mKjE6FJ/black#23): after minor pieces are developed, push for center control before rooks.
- [White London](https://lichess.org/eZGhhtgA/white#12): missed free rook with bishop on long diagonal
- [Black Najdorf](https://lichess.org/kZofv8hB/black#35): pre-emptive defensive move, weakening king pawn structure. Need to calculate more.
