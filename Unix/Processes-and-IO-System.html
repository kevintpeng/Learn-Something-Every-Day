<p>Processes have ids, PIDs. Processes can spawn other decendents, who inherit the environment variables of their parent process.</p>
<ul><li>sub processes can change variables, but do not effect their parent</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.honeybadger.io/ruby-guide-environment-variables/">source</a></p>
<ul>
<li>when program is executed, a special environment is created for it, containing everything it needs to run</li>
<li>when a command is issued, a new process is started</li>
<li>OS tracks rpocesses with five digit ID (pid)</li>
<li>
<strong>Foreground Processes</strong> take input from keyboard and output to screen (think commands)</li>
<li>
<strong>Background Processes</strong> run in background, you can run other commands while they're running</li>
<li>each unix process has pid and <em>parent process id</em> (ppid), run <code>ps -f</code> for info</li>
<li>when a child ps is killed, SIGCHLD is sent to the parent (for it to create a new ps or act)</li>
<li>
<strong>Daemon Processes</strong> are system-related background processes, have no controlling terminal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anonymous-pipe">Anonymous Pipe</h3>
<p>An anonymous pipe is a one-way FIFO channel for communication between processes.</p>
<ul><li>typically a parent program opens anonymous pipes, spawns child processes that inherit other ends of the pipes<ul><li>or creates several processes and arranges them in a pipeline</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h3 id="file-descriptors">File Descriptors</h3>
<p>A <strong>handle</strong> is just an abstract reference to some resource outside the scope of your software (think like accessing memory in a database or from the OS). A <strong>File Descriptor</strong> is a type of handle</p>
<h4 id="inode">inode</h4>
<p>Data structure that describes a filesystem object (file/directory), with metadata attributes, disk block location as well as the object's data</p>
<ul><li>must include size in bytes, device ID (containing inode), user ID of owner, group ID, file permissions mode, timestamp for last modified &amp; accessed, link count for number of hard links</li></ul>
