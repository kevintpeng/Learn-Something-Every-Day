<h1 id="redundant-array-of-independent-drives">Redundant Array of Independent Drives</h1>          <a href="index.html">Back to Unix</a>
<p>I'll be focusing on RAID 0, which is a configuration for high performance using multiple drives.</p>
<p>RAID is a configuration on a system which can abstractly allows a collection of drives to be treated logically as a single drive. The purpose of this is either to achieve redundancy for hardening a system and/or achieving performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>RAID 0 = striping, no fault tolerence but efficient performance<ul><li>when writing with two physical drives backing a RAID 0 drive, effectively half of the data is written to one and half to the other</li></ul>
</li>
<li>note the raid controller is the interface that handles how RAID is implemented, and can be software or hardware level</li>
<li>
<code>/dev</code> in linux is a collection of files representing devices that our system has access to<ul>
<li>see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/device_naming.html">aws documentation</a> on device naming schemes on ec2</li>
<li>
<code>sda1</code> is for root, <code>sd[b-z]</code>, <code>hd[a-z]</code>, <code>xvd[a-z]</code> are possible names for aws mounted drives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>mdadm</code> is a linux utility that allow us to monitor and manage software RAID devices<ul>
<li>
<code>cat /proc/mdstat</code> shows status of all raids</li>
<li>this is the primary entry point for verifying if a raid volume is configured</li>
<li>"Personalities" tells you raid level</li>
<li>md_123 can be pronounced "multiple devices #123"<ul>
<li>
<code>active</code> tells us it's working, <code>started</code> is still configuring, <code>inactive</code> means broken</li>
<li>the next space delimited list is the devices used</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<code>LVM (Logical Volume Manager)</code> is a thin software layer atop hard disks which creates an abstraction for partitioning, managing, replacing and backing up hard drives<ul>
<li>logical volumes can be created to include RAID functionality, where a LV's parts can be striped across multiple physical as in RAID 0</li>
<li>on the flip side, many logical volumes can map to a single physical volume, where different paths in a unix filesystem are the multiple logical volumes sitting atop a single physical volume</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
