<li>
<strong>AWS Storage Gateway</strong> facilitates connections between on-premise applications and AWS storage infrastructure and provides a cache<ul>
<li>three configurations: gateway-cached volumes, gateway-stored volumes and gateway-virtual tape libraries</li>
<li>gateway-cache volumes allow you to expand local storage capacity using S3 for up to 1 PB of data/gateway</li>

<li>gateway virtual tape libraries are for archiving data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Amazon Cloudfront</strong> is a CDN service<ul>
<li>useful for globally distributed consumers of some AWS resource, uses geo-location to route users to the closest cache; edge location</li>
<li>cache eviction can be forced, otherwise it depends on the TTL for objects<ul><li>caches can be configured to invalidate certain old records (based on Time To Live), but asset versioning at the API level is best practice</li></ul>
</li>
<li>not for single location users</li>
<li>optimized to work with S3 objects and EC2 or ELB</li>
<li>can be used for dynamic content, with multiple origins, and can be configured for different cache behavior as needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
