<p><strong>Simple Queue Service</strong> is a message queue system that stores messages as they move between servers</p>
<ul>
<li>does not guarantee preservation of order of messages</li>
<li>acts as a buffer (default 4 days, up to 14), allowing either server to have downtime without loss of messages</li>
<li>useful especially if processing servers cannot fully handle spiky load, allowing messages to be queued up in high traffic spikes</li>
<li>
<strong>visibility timeouts</strong> are configurable periods of time for how much message processing time is allowed before passing the message to a different component for processing</li>
<li>
<strong>delay queues</strong> are similar in that they configure a period of time in which a message is unavailable, but different in that the message is invisible in a delay queue</li>
<li>
<strong>long polling</strong> is a configuration that can drastically reduce CPU-cycle cost and load by adding a wait period between polls (1 to 20 seconds)</li>
<li>provides a layer of access control, more fine-grained than IAM (like what content is viewable from a certain account in an SQS queue)</li>
</ul>
