<p>Compute is the amount of resources (Memory, CPU, Network Performance, Storage) required to fulfill a workload. EC2 is Amazon's offering for compute. There are many flavors that offer different combinations of resources optimized for different kinds of tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Amazon Machine Images (AMI)</strong> are the initial state for EC2 instances (snapshot of computer state)</li>
<li>security groups act as a firewall for inbound (and outbound) network traffic</li>
<li>storage is ephemeral unless an Elastic Block Storage Volume (EBS) is mounted</li>
<li>three instance types: on-demand, reserved and spot</li>
<li>spot instances are cheapest and are purchased based on highest bidding customers, which means machines can be shut down at any time based on market demand</li>
<li>
<strong>placement groups</strong> are logical groups of instances that allow for co-location within availability zones to reduce network latency</li>
<li>
<strong>Elastic Block Store</strong> provides persistent block storage, which is useful for durability where instance storage isn't sufficient<ul>
<li>magnetic volumes are cheapest</li>
<li>general-purpose SSD which accumulates I/O operations per second (IOPS) credits when inactive and otherwise are slightly rate limited for cost efficiency</li>
<li>provisioned IOPS SSDs allow you to specify I/O requirements and pay for what you need</li>
<li>EBS contends for some of the network throughput for an instance, and I imagine that I/O operations have significantly higher latency than on instance storage while costing more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Amazon EBS-optimized instances ensure additional dedicated network capacity for the EBS I/O</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scripting">Scripting</h3>
<p><code>user data</code> is a configurable parameter that allows execution of scripts or configuration tasks</p>
<ul>
<li>two types are shell scripts and cloud-init directives</li>
<li>cloud-init is a tool across many linux distributions for automating config and setup alongside AMIs or as a part of AMIs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="block-device-mapping"><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html">Block Device Mapping</a></h3>
<p>Each system has an associated root device volume (EBS or instance store). Block device mapping allows additional EBS or instances store volumes to be attached to the system on launch.</p>
<ul><li>a <strong>block device</strong> is a OS-level concept</li></ul>
